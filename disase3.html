                            What is Cancer?
                            Cancer is a group of diseases characterized by the uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells in the body. If not controlled, it can invade nearby tissues and spread to other parts of the body through the blood and lymph systems.
                            
                            
                            
                            Types of Cancer:
                            There are more than 100 types of cancer, including:
                            - Carcinomas: Affect skin or tissues lining internal organs (e.g., lung, breast, colon).
                            - Sarcomas: Affect bones, cartilage, fat, muscles, or connective tissues.
                            - Leukemias: Affect blood and bone marrow.
                            - Lymphomas: Affect the immune system (lymphatic system).
                            
                            
                            
                            Causes and Risk Factors
                            - Genetic mutations (can be inherited or acquired)
                            - Lifestyle factors: Smoking, unhealthy diet, lack of exercise
                            - Environmental exposures: Radiation, chemicals
                            - Infections: Certain viruses like HPV, Hepatitis B or C
                            - Aging: Risk increases with age

                            - Unexplained weight loss
                            - Persistent fatigue
                            - Changes in skin (e.g., lumps, sores, or discoloration)
                            - Pain or swelling

                            Diagnosis
                            Cancer is diagnosed through various tests, such as:
                            - Imaging tests: X-rays, CT scans, MRI
                            - Biopsy: A sample of tissue is analyzed for cancer cells
                            - Blood tests: To identify markers linked to certain types of cancer

                            Treatment Options
                            Treatment depends on the type and stage of cancer:
                            1. Surgery: Removing the tumor
                            2. Chemotherapy: Using drugs to kill cancer cells
                            3. Radiation Therapy: Using high-energy rays to destroy cancer
                            4. Immunotherapy: Boosting the immune system to fight cancer
                            5. Targeted Therapy: Drugs that target specific cancer cells
                            6. Hormone Therapy: For cancers like breast or prostate cancer
