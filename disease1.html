						<h3>More about Corona</h3>

						<p> The 2019 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019
							(COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The
							outbreak was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China, in December 2019, and was recognized
							as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020.As of 22 March, more
							than 312,000 cases of COVID-19 have been reported in over 188 countries and territories,
							resulting in more than 13,000 deaths and 95,000 recoveries.

						<P>The virus is spread between people primarily via respiratory droplets produced during
							coughing.[disputed â€“ discuss] These droplets can also be produced from sneezing and normal
							exhalation, and the virus may spread from touching contaminated surfaces and then touching
							one's face. It is most contagious when people are symptomatic, although spread may be
							possible before symptoms appear. The time between exposure and symptom onset is typically
							around five days, but may range from two to fourteen days. Common symptoms include fever,
							cough, and shortness of breath. Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory
							distress syndrome. There is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment. Primary treatment is
							symptomatic and supportive therapy. Recommended preventive measures include hand washing,
							covering the mouth when coughing, maintaining distance from other people, and monitoring and
							self-isolation for people who suspect they are infected.
							Efforts to prevent the virus spreading include travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews,
							event postponements and cancellations, and facility closures. These include a quarantine of
							Hubei, nationwide quarantines in Italy and elsewhere in Europe, curfew measures elsewhere in
							China and South Korea, various border closures or incoming passenger restrictions, screening
							at airports and train stations,[18] and travel advisories regarding regions with community
							transmission. Schools and universities have closed either on a nationwide or local basis in
							over 124 countries and affecting more than 1.2 billion students.</P>

						<p>The pandemic has led to global socioeconomic disruption, the postponement or cancellation of
							sporting and cultural events, and widespread fears of supply shortages which have spurred
							panic buying. Misinformation and conspiracy theories about the virus have spread online, and
							there have been incidents of xenophobia and racism against Chinese and other East or
							Southeast Asian people.</p>
