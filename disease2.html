                        <p>Tuberculosis (TB): Causes and Transmission

                            Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis. This bacterium
                            primarily infects the lungs but can spread to other parts of the body. TB spreads from
                            person to person through the air. When someone with active pulmonary TB coughs, sneezes,
                            speaks, or sings, tiny droplets containing the bacteria are released into the air. People
                            nearby can inhale these droplets and become infected.

                            However, not everyone who is exposed to TB will become infected. The risk of transmission
                            depends on factors like:
                            1. *Duration of Exposure:* Prolonged contact with someone with active TB increases the risk.
                            2. *Environment:* Crowded, poorly ventilated spaces facilitate the spread of TB.
                            3. *Immune System Strength:* People with weakened immune systems (e.g., those with HIV,
                            diabetes, or malnutrition) are more susceptible to infection.

                            There are two types of TB infection:
                            - *Latent TB Infection (LTBI):* The bacteria remain dormant in the body and do not cause
                            symptoms or spread to others.
                            - *Active TB Disease:* The bacteria multiply, causing symptoms and becoming contagious.

                            Preventing TB transmission involves:
                            - Early detection and treatment of active TB cases.
                            - Isolating infected individuals during the contagious period.
                            - Vaccination with the BCG vaccine in high-risk populations.
                            - Maintaining proper ventilation in homes and public spaces.

                            TB transmission can be effectively reduced by following these measures and ensuring proper
                            adherence to treatment protocols.</p>
